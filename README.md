This function will take an array of alien words and will attempt to
determine the alphabetical order of the alien alphabet. If the words
are not correctly ordered or there is not enough data provided to
determine the alphabetical order of the alien alphabet, an empty array
will be returned.

## Getting Started

The test cases are located in the test-cases.js file. The first set
of test cases are valid data that will return an array of letters.
The second set of test cases are invalid test cases which will return
an empty array. These invalid test cases either have contradicting
data, or there was not enough words provided to determine the alphabetical order.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm run jest
```
